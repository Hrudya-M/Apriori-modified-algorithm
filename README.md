# 🛒 Modified Apriori Algorithm with Advanced Features

This project implements an **enhanced version of the Apriori algorithm** for association rule mining using Python.  
It extends the classical Apriori approach by incorporating **dynamic support selection, advanced rule filtering, additional interestingness metrics, and rich visualizations**.

The implementation is suitable for **educational purposes, data mining projects, and market basket analysis demonstrations**.

## 🚀 Features

- Transaction preprocessing and encoding
- Dynamic minimum support selection based on dataset size
- Frequent itemset mining using Apriori
- Strong association rule generation with confidence & lift filtering
- Additional **Kulczynski metric** computation
- Multiple visualizations:
  - Support bar chart
  - Lift vs Confidence scatter plot
  - Association network graph
- Comparative performance visualization (illustrative)

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NetworkX
- MLxtend (for Apriori & Association Rules)
